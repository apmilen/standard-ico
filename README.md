# Standard Token Sale

This repository contains two standard [Dappsys](http://dappsys.info)-driven token sale contracts. The first one is a standard hard-capped and fixed-price token sale with a time limit and optional soft-cap. The second one adds in a whitelisted presale period where the sale operator can add a series of tranches (in terms of volume) that offer a better price than the public sale. Both contracts accept raw ETH (i.e. not ERC20 Wrapped-ETH) via the fallback function. 

## NOTICE

This software is distributed **without warranty**. I do accept liability for anyone's token sale. If you don't perform the necessary steps to register your token with the proper authorities, that's entirely your own fault. Please follow the law when selling financial instruments to the public.
